<table><tr><td> <em>Instructions: </em> <p>Using this template, you&#39;ll be working with the entire class on the first Mini Project.
You&#39;ll pick two issues from the following GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/MattToegel/IS601-004">https://github.com/MattToegel/IS601-004</a> (you&#39;ll need to be invited as a collaborator to view it).
For each issue, you&#39;ll have a similar assignment (this one is Template 1).
Fill out the below deliverables for your chosen issues (Issue 1 = Template 1; Issue 2 = Template 2).
Although the templates will appear similar it&#39;s important to use them separately.</p>
<ol>
<li>You may work with this repository directly via GitHub or you may have a local copy and use the command line</li>
<li>Find the related issue you want to work on and assign it to yourself (do not assign yourself to an issue already assigned to someone else)<ol>
<li>If you want to swap issues with someone, communicate with them, record the agreement in the issue comment section, and assign/unassign yourselves</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Create a new branch from main using the format/naming mentioned in the Desired Branch Name below</li>
<li>Create a new markdown file (.md) titled based on the git command you&#39;ll cover (don&#39;t include spaces in the title; you may use - and _ instead)</li>
<li>Fill out the below prompts<ol>
<li>Any request screenshots may be pasted into your Issue&#39;s comment section and you may grab the generated URL / Image markdown from there to paste into this tool</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Save the response</li>
<li>Copy the markdown to your clipboard (via the given button)</li>
<li>Paste the content into the .md file from step 3 and save the file</li>
<li>Edit the main README.md file, fill in the table of contents for your chosen Issue, and paste a link to your generated .md file so it links properly when merged to the main branch<ol>
<li>Be mindful of other students, you may want to pull any pending changes prior to adding your entry. Part of this assignment is to get familiar with working in a collaborative environment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Add/commit/push the changes to GitHub </li>
<li>Merge your pull request to main (be sure to avoid any conflicts/issues with other classmates. If they occur, resolve them with your classmates)</li>
<li>From your personal branch, submit the direct link to this .md file</li>
</ol>
